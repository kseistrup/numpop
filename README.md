# NumPoppy

Pete Deas' [NumPop](https://petedeas.co.uk/numpop.html) game implemented
in Python 3.

## How to play

> You have ten turns to gain as many points as you can. Every turn, you
> can pop two adjacent numbers a and b, gaining (a + b) % 10 points. As
> a special bonus, if you would gain no points by doing so, you will gain
> a turn instead of using one up.

> When you pop two numbers, they will be replaced at the site of popping
> by the number of points you got, and a random number will be added at
> the right-hand-side of the list.

## Requirements
